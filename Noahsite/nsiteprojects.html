	<h2>The Coffemug</h2>
	<p>This was from class follow along showing the class how to make 3D modles to in Cinama 4D. In the end I made a green coffemug on an orange saucer in the shape of a cog wheel for a clock or somthing. </p>

	<h2>The Final Twinkie</h2>
	<p>This was a final for my anmation class back in Lincoln Land. This was made in blender because it was free to use and we all couldn't get Cinama 4D to work on our laptops with out exploding. The project was to make a twinkie because why not. So I made a delicious looking twinkie on a christmas theme plate because it was christmas around the time of this. In the end I made a very delicious looking twinkie and I was so hungary after wards. </p>

	<h2>The Solar Solar System</h2>
	<p> This was an assignment from my animation class and it was to make a small solar system with things our teacher provided.
