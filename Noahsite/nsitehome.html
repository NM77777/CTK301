	<h2>Welcome</h2>

	<p>	Hello and welcome to the Noahsite where you can get all of you favortie Noah content. The picture about is a Krabby the crab the sites' mascot. He is here to greet everyone with a nice warm crab smile. This site currently has four pages and those pages are the home page, about page, video page and the projects page.</p>

	<h2>Home Page</h2>
	<p>	This page is the main directory for the whole stie. Giving first times users of the Noahsite descrptions of each scetion of the site, so they have an idea of what each sections has in store for them. Be sure to come back often to see new things added to the site. Also have fun exploring!</p>

	<h2 class="or">About Page</h2>
	<p>	This page is about what this website is for and why I build it in the first place.</p>

	<h2 class="gr">Video Page</h2>
	<p>	This page is about videos I made to either show off a project or the video being the project itself. I know the nav button has the word video on it and not videos, and that is because there is currently only one video on the site. Hopefully I will add more videos so everyone that comments on this site can shut up about it. </p>

	<h2 class="br">Projects Page</h2>
	<p> This page is about showing off projects I have work on in the past or I'm currently working on. This page is layed out with image atop showing what the project looks like and a short descrption of what the project is. 	</p>
